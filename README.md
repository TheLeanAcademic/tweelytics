# tweelytics
An excessively quaint Python package for Twitter analytics

## Principles

  * For educational purposes, then research purposes.
  * Excessively quaint (pretty) in code, documentation, and visualisations.
  * Built *with* tweepy and other packages, not in competition.
  * Includes only the most useful analytical tools, nothing more.

## Alternatives

  * [TBC]
